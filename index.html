        <h4>Orphism Poetry</h4>
        <p>Orphism Poetry is an experiment on how to use wearable technology as a tool of self-expression and communication. In this project, clothing becomes both a canvas a that captures the surrounding ambient light as its paint. Users can use it in a playful way to explore the environment and to express their mind through colours in the environment. Besides, it was also an experiment on how the aesthetics of modern art may shifts from the static canvas to self-learning,ever changing smart wearable costume. The ambiguity of this project can most likely trigger impromptu interaction that leads to a wide range of speculation and imagination. Through this way, emotions, such as beauty, awe, surprise, sadness, anger, and even disgust can be generated and transmit through users and their audiences.</p>
